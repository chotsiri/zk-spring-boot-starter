very basic demo to demonstrate how fast you can start a ZK-application

_in order to run the demo's you should have [zk-spring-boot-starter](https://github.com/dirkdeyne/zk-spring-boot-starter/tree/master/zk-spring-boot-starter)_

## Run this demos
* start [ZkBootDemo](https://github.com/dirkdeyne/zk-spring-boot-starter/blob/master/zk-spring-boot-demos/zkboot-hello/src/main/java/be/enyed/zkboot/ZkBootDemo.java) as a spring boot application.
* browse to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## What do we learn?
by simply providing our applications home-page `zk.homepage = hello` in [application.properties](https://github.com/dirkdeyne/zk-spring-boot-starter/blob/master/zk-spring-boot-demos/zkboot-hello/src/main/resources/application.properties) we are good to GO.
